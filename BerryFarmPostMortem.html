<br><strong>Project Name:</strong> Berry Farm Game
<br><strong>Project type:</strong> Unity Game Project
<br><strong>Time Frame:</strong> 17/7/2017 – 5/10/2017
</p>
<p>Berry Farm began as a game jam submission for the GMTK jam (Game Maker’s Toolkit jam, which was hosted by a popular YouTube personality) and was made by two people, myself and Oleg (who I had worked on Tilted with). It was a 48-hour game jam, so we spent an intense weekend writing code and making assets. The game itself was a clicker style farming sim where you used the mouse to clear, sow, water and harvest crops and then sold or replanted them. </p>
<p>The brief timeframe made it difficult to find play-testers and find time to playtest before the game was submitted to GMTK Game Jam. However, after the jam we got some feedback on it from online comments by other participants. Most people agreed that it was a fun game, although it didn’t fit the theme of the jam very well. </p>
<p>We decided to expand the game after the jam, adding in the features we had to cut due to the tight deadline such as a shop and automated planting/harvesting equipment. We completely reworked how field tiles interacted, cutting down on duplicate code (hastily written as part of the game jam). This allowed for more tiles to be spawned when the player wanted to purchase new field tiles without slowing down the game. Originally, we had limited the size of the playing field to avoid spawning issues. We added a movable camera to allow the player to have as large a field as they could afford without losing sight of the berries they had planted. </p>
<p>We also added difficulty settings. From the comments we received, we found that some people liked the slow paced, relaxing farm game that our jam submission began as while others preferred the fast-paced clicker/strategy experience that the game turned into after a few in game day cycles. Different difficulty levels and tweakable variables such as day length helped players to gain the optimal experience from the game.</p>

    <h3>The Good</h3><ul>
<li>The game was fun from the outset</li>
<li>We got to include all the features we wanted in the extended after-jam version</li>
<li>We got online feedback on the game</li>
<li>Full background music and sound effects</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<ul><li>Our schedules became busy after the voting for the game jam was finished, which delayed the revised post-jam edition of the game to early October.
</li>
<li>When we released the post-jam version of Berry Farm it was more difficult to get feedback since the judging for the game jam had been finished for some time. We asked family and friends to play the new version to partially compensate this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Learning Experience:</h3>
<ul><li>Large game jams can be useful for feedback on games</li>
<li>Working with someone else in a game jam drastically increases how much you can get done in the jam time</li></ul>
    
    <p>I really enjoyed making this game and adding features to it to improve the experience.
