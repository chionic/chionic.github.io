<div class="contentModuleHeader">AIB Datathon</div>
    <p>
<br><strong>Project Name:</strong> AIB Datathon
<br><strong>Project type:</strong> Machine learning project using python
<br><strong>Time Frame:</strong> 18/11/2017
</p>
<p>When I was looking up information about this event before I went, I found relatively little about it online, a few <a href= "https://www.independent.ie/storyplus/the-aib-datahack-can-you-hack-it-34382179.html"> news stories</a> and a couple of <a href="https://github.com/JohnMalmsteen/aib-datathon"> github</a><a href="https://github.com/IvanFox/AIB_Datathon"> solutions</a> from past years. So here is a blog post including some less technical details of the event.</p>
<p>The datathon and hackathon start time was announced to be at 8:00. Teams lined up just inside the entrance to get table numbers and arm bands for the event. We were assigned a table number (43) and went inside. The datathon and hackathon were both held in a single large room, a canteen/auditorium area. The event itself was on the ground floor but you could see the (glass) roof of the building and the offices of higher floors surrounding this central area. As we came into the event we received free goodie bags and a t-shirt to commemorate the dattathon/hackathon. We were then led to our table by staff.</p>
<p>Breakfast was available all morning, served in a smaller room adjoining the main area. We could eat anywhere we wanted though, such as the table where we were working on the problem set. We set up our computers at the table we were assigned. Someone came around to tell us the password to unlock the datafiles they had asked us to download the previous day. We started on the question – predicting the number of bikes on a given day that would be used from a public biking service, similar to Dublin Bikes.</p>
<p>Around 12.00 a warm lunch was available at the canteen. Throughout the day spot prizes were announced for various side competitions (for example the best event related tweet). The staff were helpful in answering questions and problem shooting google drive issues (every team had a google drive folder for submitting their solutions). Throughout the day there was a leader board to show the top teams in the datathon at that moment. The screen it was presented on also had a large countdown clock for the end of the competition. The screen was off to the side and unobtrusive. </p>
<p>The datathon competition ended at 17.30 (the hackathon ended earlier). Sandwiches, beer and soft drinks were served in the canteen area as everyone packed up their tech. Videogames and other entertainment which hadn’t been used very mcuch while the competition was running were now in high demand as people waited for the results to be announced. My teammate and I left the event early because the train station we were going to use for transport home would be closed at 18:30 due to a rugby match in the area.

<p>Some suggestions to help prepare for the day (specifically the datathon):</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and get used to any tools you’ll be using on the day. We used sql with visual studio to sort the data (I wouldn’t advise this approach in retrospect) and python with scikit learn, numpy and pandas to get a machine learning algorithm up and running.</li>
<li>Create a sample read in and write out .csv script in the programme(s) you’re going to be using. The data we received was in the form of a comma separated values text file. Having the code to read this in to relevant programmes beforehand is going to save you time on the day.</li>
<li>Bring a USB stick, teams have two members and having a fast way to transfer files (that doesn’t rely on the busy wifi network) between laptops is useful.</li>
<li>There are a lot of sample machine learning datasets out there, try a few (of varying sizes) to get a feel for your tools.</li>
<li>Online graphing tools such as plot.ly (https://plot.ly/create/) are great for getting an initial sense of the data and quickly spotting outliers.</li></ul>
