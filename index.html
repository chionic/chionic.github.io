<p>When I was looking up information about this event before I went, I found relatively little about it online, a few <a href= “https://www.independent.ie/storyplus/the-aib-datahack-can-you-hack-it-34382179.html”> news stories</a> and a couple of <a href=”https://github.com/JohnMalmsteen/aib-datathon”> github</a><a href =” https://github.com/IvanFox/AIB_Datathon> solutions</a> from past years. So here is a blog post including some less technical details of the event.</p>

<div class="contentModuleHeader">World Turtle Dreams Post Mortem</div>
<br><ul>
<li>Project Name: World Turtle Dreams Game</li>
<li>Project type: Processing Game Project</li>
<li>Time Frame: 25/6/2017 – 4/7/2017</li>
</ul>


<p>This was a game I created as my first entry for #1GAM (One Game a Month). I started it very late in the month and so tried to keep it small and manageable for the time frame I had. I wanted to recreate and improve on one of my favourite flash games from my childhood – Jelly Blobs of Doom. I chose the Processing language for this project because I was already familiar with it from my college studies and it was a language I could prototype in quickly.

<p>Recently I made a game using processing and processing.js,<a href="worldTurtleDreamsPostMortem.html"> you can read the post mortem about it here</a>. It was my first time working with processing.js and using sound and graphic files in my game caused me some trouble. In case anyone else has similar problems, here is a breakdown of how I got my sound effects and custom pixel art to work with processing.js</p>
