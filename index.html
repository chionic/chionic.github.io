<br><ul><li>Project Name: Berry Farm Game</li>
    <li>Project type: Unity Game Project</li>
    <li>Time Frame: 17/7/2017 – 5/10/2017</li></ul>

<p>
Berry Farm began as a game jam submission for the GMTK jam (Game Maker’s Toolkit jam, which was hosted by a popular YouTube personality) and was made by two people, myself and Oleg (who I had worked on Tilted with). It was a 48-hour game jam, so we spent an intense weekend writing code and making assets.</p>

<br><ul><li>Project Name: AIB Datathon</li>
    <li>Project type: Machine learning project using python</li>
    <li>Time Frame: 18/11/2017</li></ul>

<p>When I was looking up information about this event before I went, I found relatively little about it online, a few <a href= “https://www.independent.ie/storyplus/the-aib-datahack-can-you-hack-it-34382179.html”> news stories</a> and a couple of <a href=”https://github.com/JohnMalmsteen/aib-datathon”> github</a><a href =” https://github.com/IvanFox/AIB_Datathon> solutions</a> from past years. So here is a blog post including some less technical details of the event.</p>

    <div class="contentModuleHeader">Tilted Post Mortem</div>
<br><ul><li>Project Name: Tilted</li>
    <li>Project type: Unity Game Project</li>
    <li>Time Frame: Jan 2017 - Sept 2017</li></ul>

<p>
We chose to make our game in Unity because it was an accessible engine with a large community and lots of tutorials, both from the Unity Engine team and other community members. We started out knowing very little about how to use the Unity Engine, we began by following the first tutorial on Unity’s website – Roll A Ball. From this tutorial we got the idea of letting the player move the platform around the ball instead of the ball itself (like the tutorial did). We got a prototype up and running and designed a level for it to test if the prototype worked and was engaging to play. We liked it and started making a few sample levels using the idea – some of which ended up staying in the final build of the game.</p>

<div class="contentModuleHeader">World Turtle Dreams Post Mortem</div>
<br><ul>
<li>Project Name: World Turtle Dreams Game</li>
<li>Project type: Processing Game Project</li>
<li>Time Frame: 25/6/2017 – 4/7/2017</li>
</ul>


<p>This was a game I created as my first entry for #1GAM (One Game a Month). I started it very late in the month and so tried to keep it small and manageable for the time frame I had. I wanted to recreate and improve on one of my favourite flash games from my childhood – Jelly Blobs of Doom. I chose the Processing language for this project because I was already familiar with it from my college studies and it was a language I could prototype in quickly.

<br><br><br><div class="contentModuleHeader">Processing to Processing.js Graphic and Sound Files</div><br>
<p>Recently I made a game using processing and processing.js,<a href="worldTurtleDreamsPostMortem.html"> you can read the post mortem about it here</a>. It was my first time working with processing.js and using sound and graphic files in my game caused me some trouble. In case anyone else has similar problems, here is a breakdown of how I got my sound effects and custom pixel art to work with processing.js</p>
