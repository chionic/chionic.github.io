This was the first time I was part of a team to make a game. I had completed my first semester of college and wanted to use and improve my programming ability by making something.</p><p>
We chose to make our game in Unity because it was an accessible engine with a large community and lots of tutorials, both from the Unity Engine team and other community members. We started out knowing very little about how to use the Unity Engine, we began by following the first tutorial on Unity’s website – Roll A Ball. From this tutorial we got the idea of letting the player move the platform around the ball instead of the ball itself (like the tutorial did). We got a prototype up and running and designed a level for it to test if the prototype worked and was engaging to play. We liked it and started making a few sample levels using the idea – some of which ended up staying in the final build of the game. </p><center><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTgxODg2Lzg0OTkzMy5wbmc=/original/T8vNFg.png" height="110px" width="111px"></center><p>
Over the next few months we designed more levels with more complex mechanics to keep the game engaging and to create greater challenge for the player as they progressed through it. We created a story around the ball’s journey through these levels, added sound effects and music, created custom 3d models and textures for the game. Throughout this process of adding features we debugged, a lot. The final month of development we spent almost entirely debugging and polishing.</p><p>
One thing that really helped us make the game what it is and to catch bugs early was playtesting. We started play testing as soon as we had a playable build of the game. We loaded a copy of the game build onto a couple USB sticks and brought them into college. Then we asked friends to play the game in one of the computer rooms. While they play tested we attracted other college students, who came up to us to see what was going on. We asked them if they would like to try the game as well and some of them did.</p><p>
Playtesting was especially helpful when it came to level design. Watching people play through the game, we quickly saw if there was a sharp increase in difficulty from one level to the next or if a certain pickup was especially difficult to get to. We ended up rearranging the levels to even out the difficulty curve or changing the position of pickups/ removing obstacles if a level was too difficult too early.</p><center><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTgxODg2Lzg0OTkzNC5wbmc=/original/DEcXck.png" height="110px" width="111px"></center><p>
    
This was our first team project, for most of us our first project beyond college assignments. We didn’t know about a lot of industry best practices – creating a game manager and sound manager for example or writing a design document. We just added features to it as we went along and managed to create a complete game in the end but this approach came with its own set of problems.</p><p>
One of the difficulties we ran into was time management. There were five of us making this game and we all had different schedules, college or school assignments to hand in and other obligations. This was a hobby project for us so the time we could dedicate to the project each week varied drastically. Near the end of year college/school exams the pace the project developed slowed to a crawl and then at other times we would get an entire world, with its own central mechanic, done in a single week.</p><p>
Organisation was our biggest hurdle with the project though – we were adding what we wanted to the game as we thought of it without much regard for organising everything into folders to make it easier to find or even telling all our team mates about what we had added or how to use it in their own levels. When I started writing code, I didn’t document everything properly and especially with the many script references we ended up adding into different scripts, this made it difficult for anyone to write code that interfaced with mine. This was something I fixed and implemented in all my other side projects and in the later parts of this project.</p><center><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTgxODg2Lzg0OTkzMi5wbmc=/original/Ej7uoZ.png" height="110px" width="111px"></center><p>
Tilted turned out to be a massive learning experience for me. When I started working on the game, I had to look up and refer to google, stack overflow or a unity tutorial and the unity scripting documentation for almost everything I wanted to do. I had never worked with such a substantial library of functions before and the idea of calling scripts from other scripts was still completely new to me. </p><p>
By Tilted’s completion I had learned most of the unity functions I would use often and understood how different components and scripts interacted. I could read most of the common error messages and fix them without spending a couple hours googling. I could go straight to unity’s documentation page to find the function I wanted or write my own if the function wasn’t available.</p><p>
To date Tilted is the game I’m most proud of contributing to and I’m going to use everything I learned in making Tilted in the next game our hobby group is creating (this one is going to be about slimes). You can play Tilted for free on the Windows platform by downloading it from the itch.io page <a href="https://chionic.itch.io/tilted">here</a>.</p>
